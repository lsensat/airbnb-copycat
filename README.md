# AIRBNB COPYCAT

I created an Airbnb copy to sharpen my skills, as it performs all CRUD actions:
- Users can create/login/delete an account
- Users can create/edit/delete flats/houses with pictures
- Users can search for places, navigate on a map, and choose places to know more
- Users can book, see bookings and cancel bookings
- Users can review
- Users can like and unlike the place
- Users can start chatting with hosts (new)
